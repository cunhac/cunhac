# Hey, I'm Carol! Welcome my GitHub! 👋


I'm in career transition to software development. 👩‍💻 

I have developed some projects and published here as a portfolio of experiences acquired through my studies.


I'm curious 👀 and I really like to learn 📖 and share knowledge 🤝. 

The technology area is one of constant innovation 💾 💿 ☁️ and this motivates me a lot! 🚀
